# Image Processing colorizer

## Introduction

Image processing can be defined as a method of performing some operations on an image in order to get an enhanced image or extract some useful information from it. In this project, we tried to use a pre-trained model to color images mentioned in the research paper ‘Colorful Image Colorization’.  

The model is trained to identify scenery and also humans to a detailed level and perform colorization on them.

## Demo Application
